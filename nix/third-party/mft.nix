# Mellanox Firmware Tools (MFT), prebuilt, for x86_64 hosts and aarch64.
#
# The scout discovery image ships the full MFT suite — 57 binaries including
# flint, mst, mlxconfig, mlxlink, mlxfwreset and mlxcables. nixpkgs' `mstflint`
# is the open-source subset and provides only a handful of those, so a scout
# built on mstflint alone loses NIC firmware management and link diagnostics
# with nothing more informative than "command not found".
#
# MFT arrives in the mkosi profile as a bare `mft` at the end of the NV_PACKAGES
# list in mkosi.postinst.chroot, which is easy to miss when reading the package
# list in mkosi.conf.
#
# forge-dpu-agent consumes the same tree through crates/libmlx, which looks for
# flint on PATH or at /usr/bin/flint and /opt/mellanox/mft/bin/flint, and for
# mlxfwreset at /opt/mellanox/mft/bin/mlxfwreset (hardcoded in
# libmlx/firmware/reset.rs). mlxfwreset is a shell script driving Python tools,
# so any runtime carrying it also needs Python 3.
#
# Architecture is read from stdenv rather than passed in, so a caller selects it
# by choosing the package set: `pkgs.callPackage` for the host, or the aarch64
# cross set for the DPU. Under cross the tools in nativeBuildInputs splice to
# the build platform on their own, which is why this takes no crossPkgs
# argument the way the aarch64 file it replaces did.
