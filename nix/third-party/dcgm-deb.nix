# NVIDIA Data Center GPU Manager, from NVIDIA's published Debian packages.
#
# scout runs DCGM diagnostics on GPU nodes, so the plugin set has to match the
# CUDA version those diagnostics were qualified against — cuda13. nixpkgs
# builds DCGM from source and pins a release whose CMake only knows about CUDA
# 12; building it ourselves means carrying a rebased fix-paths patch and
# redoing that work on every DCGM release until nixpkgs bumps. Taking NVIDIA's
# binaries instead gives the exact artifacts carbide has qualified and leaves
# the maintenance at "bump a hash".
#
# The three packages mirror what the mkosi scout profiles installed:
#
#   core                 the daemon (nv-hostengine) and dcgmi
#   cuda13               diagnostic plugins built against CUDA 13
#   proprietary-cuda13   closed-source plugins the open set does not cover
#
# Their versions must match exactly — the -cuda13 package declares
# `Depends: datacenter-gpu-manager-4-core (= <same version>)`, and mixing
# versions across the plugin boundary is not something DCGM checks at runtime.
#
# Both architectures are deliberately held to one version. A scout that reports
# different diagnostic results depending on which CPU the host has is not
# something anyone can support in the field.
#
# Hashes come straight from the repository index rather than from a build
# failure. Note that the index reports an epoch (`1:4.6.1-1`) that the filename
# does not carry, so read `Filename:` rather than composing a URL from
# `Version:`. The index publishes hex, so convert rather than transcribe:
#
#   curl -sSL https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2404/<repo>/Packages.gz \
#     | gunzip | grep -A12 '^Package: datacenter-gpu-manager-4-cuda13$'
#   nix hash convert --hash-algo sha256 --to sri <hex>
