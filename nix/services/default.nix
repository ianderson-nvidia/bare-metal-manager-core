# Per-service container specifications.
#
# Every image carbide publishes starts from the same base: a distroless root
# with one binary in /bin. Most services need nothing more. The ones that do —
# a shell to exec, a directory that must exist before startup, a legacy path
# some PodSpec still references — declare those needs here, one entry per
# service, and flake.nix feeds them to mkContainer.
#
# This file holds data, not derivations, and takes no package set. The builders
# live in flake.nix so that they can share one crane `cargoArtifacts` across
# every binary; splitting them per-service would rebuild the dependency closure
# once per image. What that buys here is a file describing *what* each service
# needs, readable without knowing how any of it is assembled.
#
# FIELDS — all optional; an absent field means the service doesn't need it.
#
#   runtime           Packages placed on the image's PATH. A function of the
#                     package set rather than a plain list, because the same
#                     entry builds both the amd64 image (against `pkgs`) and
#                     the arm64 one (against `aarch64CrossPkgs`); a list would
#                     bake in whichever architecture evaluated first.
#   extraCommands     Shell run at image build time, from the image root.
#   optCarbideAliases /opt/carbide/<alias> -> /bin/<target> symlinks.
#   optCarbideDirs    Empty directories created under /opt/carbide/.
#   entrypoint        OCI Entrypoint. Set only on images that run standalone.
#                     Server-side images omit it so k8s PodSpecs stay in charge
#                     of what runs.
#   cmd               OCI Cmd, for images whose default process is not their
#                     entrypoint. See machine-validation-config.
#
# Every service that produces a container has an entry, including the many
# that need nothing beyond their binary and so are written `{ }`. flake.nix
# rejects a service missing from this file and an entry matching no service,
# which makes the list below the inventory of what carbide ships — an empty
# entry is a deliberate statement that the plain distroless image is correct,
# not an oversight.
